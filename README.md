# RPS-Sockets
Doing this project was a little tricky in spots. Trying to get the coding right to communicate properly across a network to another user on a different computer was a little confusing at first. Once I got the initial progream working with just basic gameplay I was able to add scoring and identify who won each round. I learned alot from doing this project. One thing I learned was to keep my variables consistent throughout the program. Also I learned about node modules and how to set up a socket server.
